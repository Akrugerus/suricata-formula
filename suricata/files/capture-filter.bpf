# Supports a single capture-filter.bpf file that applies to all capture interfaces.
# Suricata will need to restart in order to process newly created rules.
# http://biot.com/capstats/bpf.html for example bpf syntax
#
# Example bpf rules:
# Drop from src host to dst port
# !(src host 192.168.1.35 && dst port 161) &&
#
# Drop from src host to dst host and dst port
# !(src host 10.10.0.210 && dst host 10.10.0.200 && dst port 80) &&
#
# Drop to or from:
# !(host 8.8.8.8) &&
#
# Notice the last rule has no &&
# !(host 8.8.4.4)

# Drop AWS metada service traffic
# !(ip host 169.254.169.254 && port 80)
